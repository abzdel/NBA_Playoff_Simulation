# NBA_Playoff_Simulation
For this project, I use a multiple linear regression algorithm to predict the final NBA standings for 2020-21. I then use these standings to set up a simulation of the playoffs in Excel. Using Macros, you can simulate games thousands of times to see who has the greatest chance of winning based on standings.
