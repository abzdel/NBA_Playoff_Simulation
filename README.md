# NBA_Playoff_Simulation

## Project Overview
For this project, I use a multiple linear regression algorithm to predict the final NBA standings for 2020-21. I then use these standings to set up a simulation of the playoffs in Excel. Using Macros, you can simulate games thousands of times to see who has the greatest chance of winning based on standings.

This project is not yet finished. I would like to continue to work on the regression model as well as factor more variables into the simulation.

If you'd like to run this on your own and get more variety in your standings, you can remove random_state when training the model.

## Programs & Packages
- **Python**: Version 3.7
- **Packages**: sklearn, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
- **Excel**: For simulation
